# MSCI_2021_Project1
Optimal interpolation of sea surface elevation in polar oceans

Goal: apply a Gaussian Process methodology already implemented for sea ice freeboard optimal interpolation to sea level data from the same satellites to retrieve daily gridded sea surface height anomaly and sea surface elevations at 50 km (or higher resolution)

Data: satellite elevation data from radar altimeters (CryoSat-2, Sentinel3A, Sentinel3B, AltiKa) and optionally laser altimeter (ICESat-2). 

Tool: the Gaussian Process optimal interpolation python code developed by William Gregory as part of his paper https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/15/2857/2021/tc-15-2857-2021.html
